# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-Notebooks-
This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks as well as colab notebooks demonstrating various machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, Random Forest, and more. Each notebook is designed to provide a clear and practical implementation of these algorithms, using well-known datasets such as MNIST and Iris.

The notebooks are written in Python and were developed in Google Colab, making them easily accessible and executable in a cloud-based environment. The repository is intended for anyone interested in learning about machine learning algorithms, from beginners to more experienced practitioners.

Containes: 
linear regression on iris
logistic regression on iris

Each notebook includes:

A brief introduction to the algorithm and its use cases.
Step-by-step implementation details, with comments explaining key code sections.
Application of the algorithm to the selected dataset, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
Visualizations and results interpretation to help understand the model's performance.


Feel free to clone this repository, run the notebooks in Colab, and modify them to suit your learning or project needs.
